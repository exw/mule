Mule draws on a number of research papers, especially in the design of
its type system. Throughout the source we include {citations} in
comments, to refer to the works from which ideas come.  Pointers to
these sources are centralized here. Each entry is of the form:

    Title
    Authors
    Conference/Journal (abbreviated)
    URL (if available)

If a URL is missing it is because we have so far been unable to find a copy
not behind a paywall; if you are able to find a freely available copy, please
submit a patch adding a link.

Please keep this list sorted alphabetically by the {citation} tag.
